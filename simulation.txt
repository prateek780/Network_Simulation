  "SHORT SUMMARY": "ClassicalHost-9 sent 'hi prateek nice to meet you' to ClassicalHost-7 through a quantum-classical network with 8 nodes, involving 3 classical hops and 1 quantum hop, using simple_xor encryption and BB84 key generation.",
  "DETAILED SUMMARY": "The simulation started with ClassicalHost-9 sending a message to ClassicalHost-7 ([LOG_0011]). 
  The message was routed through ClassicalRouter-14 ([LOG_0013]) and then to QC_Router_QuantumAdapter-13 ([LOG_0016]).
  QuantumAdapter-13 initiated QKD with QuantumAdapter-11 ([LOG_0018]) and encrypted the message ([LOG_0090]).
  The encrypted message was forwarded to QC_Router_QuantumAdapter-11 ([LOG_0091]) and then to ClassicalHost-7 ([LOG_0098]).
  The message was successfully received at ClassicalHost-7 ([LOG_0099]).",
